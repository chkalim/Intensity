# TC_Intensity
A spatio-temporal Model for TC intensity
To run main file TC_intensity_ST.ipynb First need to utlized the given CMA Dataset to download ERA 5 data

ERA 5 data for (u,v,r,t) in form of  3X3 grid and 37 isobaric plans can be download from https://cds.climate.copernicus.eu/cdsapp#!/dataset/reanalysis-era5-pressure-levels?tab=form

given python file   spatial_data_extraction.py can also be used to extract spatial Data.

processed spatial data can also be downloaded from
https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1c65G2ZteK_fZqmazIGDGaW9Ki0C7mHSy

after pre-procesisng the spatial data TC_intensity_ST.ipynb can be used for TC intensity prediction.
